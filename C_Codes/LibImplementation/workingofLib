step 1 - create main program file 

step 2 - create example.h file which include declaration of all the function provided by your library 

step 3 - create example.c files where implementation is done

step 4 - compile the most preferabbly by example.o file name

step 5 - use  "$include "example.h" " in as header file in main file

step 6 - to manage multiple files , we archive them in single file using "ar rcs myLibArchiveFile.a example(output file i.e example.o) "

step 7 - compile main program file by telling to compile linker file too , linker file is archived file i.e.  myLibArchiveFile.a , so the command is 
 "gcc -o mainfileOutputFilename mainfilename.c -L. myLibArchiveFile.a"

step 8 - './mainfileOutputFilename.o' to execute the output.
